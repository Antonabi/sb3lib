# sb3lib

sb3lib is a python library, which lets you interact with a sb3 file (a scratch 3 project).

## Installation

First you have to download the repo with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Antonabi/sb3lib.git
```

To install this just use

```bash
pip install -e . # you have to first cd into sb3lib
```

.  

I will upload this to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) but only if its done. (Or atleast has more than this)

## How to use

Just import it in your python project with:

```python
import sb3lib
```

For now I will not make a documentation because:

- im too lazy
- this isnt event done

If you want to help me by adding features or fixing my shitty code, feel free to do so. (plssss!)
